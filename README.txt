# README for code used in the paper "Clarifying How Degree Entropies and Degree-Degree Correlations Relate to Network Robustness", C Jones and K Wiesner, Entropy 2022, 24(9), 1182; https://doi.org/10.3390/e24091182 #

The code in this repository was run using Python 3.9.

This repository has been organised such that the data from each figure may be independently generated and verified. The module "networkentropy" contains the functions that have been specially written by the authors for this paper.

The "network_data" folder contains a range real world networks from http://konect.cc/ and http://networkrepository.com.

The remaining files are all used to generate particular figures which appear in the paper.
